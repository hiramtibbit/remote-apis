Welcome to TextExpander!

Now you can compose emails, tweets, and other text using your own custom snippet abbreviations. Try it out now -- tap here to bring up the keyboard:
Thank you very much!
Then type "tyvm" (without the quotes).

"Thank you very much!" will appear automatically.

Expand a formatted or fill-in snippet and send it to Mail or another app using the Share button.

You can also Copy and Paste your text into another app.
